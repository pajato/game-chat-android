# The Splash Screen

This will be the first screen the User sees when there is no history
for the application while the app is starting up.  With a sufficiently
fast device the User will only see this screen for the briefest of
momemts, preferably not at all.

In the initial experience (no previous sign-in), a dialog will be
presented to allow the User to select an identify.  See the Sign-in
design notes.
